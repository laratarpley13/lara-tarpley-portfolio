                    The goal was to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to re-create designs, provided by Frontend Mentor, that were 
                    in the form of JPG images. There is the option to toggle between light and dark theme and the 
                    social media tracker is made to be responsive so it will work on both mobile and computers of different sizes.

                <p class="description">
                    Pictures of the original design can be found in the design folder of the repository and there
                    is an example of the design in the README file.

                    I love to cook and create new recipes and wanted a platform
                    that would make it easy for anyone to share their recipe creations and receive constructive feedback 
                    on the recipes in the form of pictures, as I feel like food can be a very visual experience.

                    This app allows users to create their own account and explore recipes,

                    other people's recipes and leave them feedback as well.

                    This app is inspired by my family, who likes to make hand-written to-do and shopping lists. However, when it comes 
                    time to use them to share with each other this makes it difficult to keep track 
                    of who is in charge of each task. So I wanted to make an easy to use list maker that 
                    also allows you to share the list with someone else and see when each other accomplishes 
                    a certain task.

                    I love to read, but often times I have a hard time figuring out what I would like to read. 
                    So I wanted to create an application that gives users a different medium in the form 
                    of YouTube videos, which often include interviews with the author or book reviews, to help 
                    users decide on their next read.

                    Users can select which NYT best seller's list to look through and in return for each 
                    book on the list they will get a picture of the book cover, the name of the book, the author(s), a 
                    description, the option to display YouTube videos for the book, and a purchase link.
